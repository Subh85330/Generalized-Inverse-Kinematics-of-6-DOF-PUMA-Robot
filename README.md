# Generalized-Inverse-Kinematics-of-6-DOF-PUMA-Robot
MATLAB	code	for	general	inverse	kinematics	of	the	robot	using	kinematic	decoupling.	Take	as	input. Validation	0f these results also performed using	forward	kinematics	for	all	eight	solutions.

Animation shows the movement of the robot from given initial position with the cycloidal trajectory for	T	=	3

# Input
ZXY	Euler	angles	(φ,	θ,	and	ψ)	describing	orientation	of	end-effector	and	end	effector	position	𝒑" #	(x,	y	,	z)
